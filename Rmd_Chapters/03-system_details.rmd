<a name="System_Operation_Parameters"></a> **System Operational Parameters**

* This is a closed loop system where water from each individual tank will recirculate back to a main holding reservoir (sump).  
* Normal High Tide operating water level is approximately 12.5"H for a total water volume of 14.37 gal per tank (total of 287.4 gal to fill the available 20 tanks).  
* Normal Low Tide operating water level is approximately 4"H for a total water volume of 4.60 gal per tank (92.0 gal total for the 20-tank-system).  
* Excess water drained to the sump at low tide is 9.77 gal per tank (195.4 gal total for the 20-tank-system).  
* Normal sump operating water level is 7" water in the filter cell compartment, which has an approximate volume of 82.32 gal.  Sump freeboard volume (max before overflow) is 107.39 gal.  
* Secondary sump available volume is 250 gal. To operate from a High Tide water level to a Low Tide water level, excess water must be redirected to the secondary sump to accomodate the excess volume (see below).  
* Aquaria drain pipe is in line with a 30 gal sump pump, which will draw water from the aquaria drain line and pump water to the sump.  
* Sump is in line with a secondary holding tank for sump overflow at Low Tide.
    * 195.4 gal returning to sump in a Low Tide scenario will be split between the main and secondary sumps so that water level is the same in each.  
* **Total system water volume should not exceed 390 gal - ideal water volume for this scenario is 375 gal total throughout the system**
* Flow rate for each tank can be maintained at ~2-6 GPH (See [Tidal Manipulation](07-tidal_manipulation.md) for specific flow rates).  
* Chiller is plumbed inline with the [filtration skid](https://github.com/SilbigerLab/Mesocosm_User_Manual/blob/master/Manuals/Filtration_Skid_Build_Package.pdf), which includes mechanical/biological filtration as well as UV sterilization (chemical filtration).  
* One main pump recirculates the water flow throughout the experimental tanks and the main holding reservoir.  
* Each tank has an immersion heater that allows tank temperatures to be set ~15 degF (8.3 degC) above the main holding tank reservoir.  
    * **Note: The tank needs to have low flow or be static in order to initially heat up to desired temperatures much higher than the sump.  Once the temperature has been reached in the system, then flow can be set to the normal operating rate.**  
* A small sumbersible powerhead in each tank provides water circulation throughout the tank.  
* Each tank has (2) water supply lines, each with (1) Neptune Systems flow sensor and (1) needle valve for manual flow rate control, and (1) gate solenoid valve in line with (1) supply line for programmable tidal effect.  Each tank also has (2) drain lines with (1) flow sensor in line with (1) needle valve for outgoing flow rate control, and (1) 'overflow' line for maintaining maximum tank volume.  Incoming and outgoing flow rates have to be manually adjusted for tidal effect.  
* Flow metered water lines
    * N: Main supply
    * S: Solenoid-controlled supply
    * D: Drain  
* Tidal effect
    * outgoing tide: incoming flow rate (N + S) is lower than outgoing flow rate (D).
    * incoming tide: incoming flow rate (N + S) is greater than outgoing flow rate (D).
    * Note: The tank will not be completely empty during low tide events to prevent the recirculating powerhead from running dry.  
* Each tank has (1) CO2 supply line with an airstone connected to (1) Neptune Systems solenoid valve to control the lowering and maintenance of pH in tanks.  
* CO2 scrubber comprised of (1) or (2) air compressors connected to (1) or (2) Phosban Reactors will bubble out CO2 from the sump water to bring up pH to ambient or near-ambient conditions in the holding reservoir to supply to the tanks.  
* Each tank has individual LED lighting, which can be controlled for white or blue light for natural daily light cycles or some other program.  
* Certain tank conditions can be controlled via Neptune Systems Apex Controllers.  Each Apex controls (4) tanks.  
  * Controllable parameters are: pH, temperature, tidal effect (S flow into the tank), and lighting.  
* Certain tank conditions can be monitored via Neptune Systems Apex Controllers.  Each Apex monitors and records data for (4) tanks.  
  * Monitored parameters include: pH, temperature, salinity, flow rates, relative light intensity, and the status of any set program (whether a unit is On of Off at any given time based on the program set)  

<a name="Apex_Connection_Series"></a> **Apex Connection Series**

* Each EnergyBar connects to the Base Unit with an AquaBus cable via the AquaBus Ports for power.  (2) EB832 units connect to (1) Base Unit.  
* Each CO2 Solenoid valve connects to the EnergyBar via the DC24 Accessory Port on the side of the EB832.  (2) Solenoid valves connect in (1) EB832.  
* (1)PM1 connects to (1) EnergyBar with an AquaBus cable via the AquaBus Ports, and all PM1 modules connect in series with each other for power.  
* VDM connects to the last PM1 in series with an AquaBus cable via the AquaBus Ports for power.  
* Temperature probes connect to the PM1 Temp Port or the Base Unit Temp Port.  (1) Temperature probe in each PM1, and (1) Temperature probe in the Base Unit.  
* pH probes connect to the PM1 pH/ORP Port or the Base Unit pH/ORP Port.  Push the BNC female connector of the probe on to the male connector and turn 1/4 turn clockwise to lock the connector in place.  (1) pH probe in each PM1, and (1) pH probe in the Base Unit.  
* [Halo light](https://github.com/SilbigerLab/Mesocosm_User_Manual/tree/394a3f7d9fed8765e4152f9fdd11d00a2ea87a93/Manuals/HALO_Quick_Start_Guide.pdf) connects to the VDM or Base Unit via the V1/V2 or V3/V4 Port.  (2) Light connections in the VDM and (2) Light connections in the Base Unit.  
* (1)FMM connects to (1) EnergyBar (whichever EB832 is not powering the PM1 modules) with an AquaBus cable via the AquaBus Ports, and all FMM connect in series with each other for power.  
* (3)Flow sensors connect to each FMM via (3) of the numbered ports.

4. Halo Light

<a name="Water_Flow_Operation"></a> **Water Flow Operation**

* Flow from the filtration sump to the mesocosm tanks
    * Water from the chiller can be directed either back into the sump or to the mesocosm tanks or both simultaniously.  
    * The bypass valve is used to regulate the line pressure going back to the mesocosm tanks.  The more closed, the higher the pressure in the line, and the more open, the lower the pressure.  
    * It is recommeded you maintain partial flow to the sump to maintain circulation within the sump and to not overwhelm the tanks with more water pressure than they can handle, depending on your flow rates in.   
    * Multiple valaves in line can be used to regulate the flow through the filtration system, though the chiller has a safety flow switch that requires a minimum flow rate for the chiller to operate.  
    * Minimize flow through the filtration system if you want to increase residence time of water through the UV sterilizer.  
* Flow from the mesocosm tanks to the filtration sump
    * Water from the tanks drains to an outdoor underground 30 gal compartment, which will automatically pump water out when a certain water level is reached (about 15 gal).  This water can be directed either back into the sump, or if you intend to drain water in the event of a water change or the end of an experiment, water can be directed to a drain port.
* Overflow from sump to secondary containment
    * When mesocosm water level falls from a high tide to low tide sequence, more water will drain to the sump than what the main sump can individually hold.  Excess water can be redirected from the sump (S1) to the secondary containment (S2) by opening the S2 inflow t-valve (allows simultaneous flow of filtered, chilled water to both S2 and the mesocosm tanks), and an exchange t-valve (allows for continuous flow between S1 and S2).
