Each box is used to power up to two (2) Apex units and enough modules and other devices for up to four (4) tanks.  Each outlet covering has a number corresponding to the labeling for these switches.  To turn any or all on, flip the switch(es) right to left.
1. Leave the Condenser switches (9 and 11) in the "off" position unless the chiller and filtration system become connected
