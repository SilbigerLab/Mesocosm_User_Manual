<a name="System_Operational_Sequence"></a> **System Operational Sequence**

* This is a closed loop system where water from each individual tank will recirculate back to a main holding reservoir (sump).  
* Normal High Tide operating water level is approximately 12.5"H for a total water volume of 14.37 gal per tank (287.4 gal total for the 20-tank-system).  
* Normal Low Tide operating water level is approximately 4"H for a total water volume of 4.60 gal per tank (92.0 gal total for the 20-tank-system).  
* Excess water volume to sump at low tide is 9.77 gal per tank (195.4 gal total for the 20-tank-system).  
* Normal sump operating water level is 7" water in the filter cell compartment, which has an approximate volume of 82.32 gal.  Sump freeboard volume is 107.39 gal.  
* Aquaria drain line is in line with a 30 gal sump pump, which will draw water from the aquaria drain line and pump water to the sump.
* Sump is in line with a secondary holding tank for sump overflow at Low Tide.
  * 195.4 gal returning to sump in a Low Tide scenario
  * 30 gal in sump pump
  * 107.39 gal in sump (freeboard volume)
  * 58.01 gal necessarily pumped to secondary holding tank
* Flow rate for each tank is  2-6 GPH (See [Tidal Manipulation](chapters/06-tidal_manipulation.md) for specific flow rates).  
* Chiller is plumbed inline with the [filtration skid](https://github.com/SilbigerLab/Mesocosm_User_Manual/tree/394a3f7d9fed8765e4152f9fdd11d00a2ea87a93/Manuals/Filtration_Skid_Build_Package.pdf) which includes mechanical/biological filtration as well as UV sterilization (chemical filtration).  
* One main pump recirculates the water flow throughout the experimental tanks and the main holding reservoir.  
* Each tank has an immersion heater that allows tank temperatures to be set 15 degF (8.3 degC) above the main holding tank reservoir.  
  * **Note: The tank needs to be static in order to heat up to a desired temp.  Once the temperature has been reached then it can be set to flow through mode.**  
* A small sumbersible powerhead in each tank provides water circulation throughout the tank.  
* Each tank has (2) supply lines, each with (1) flow sensor, and (1) gate valve in line with (1) supply line for tidal effect.  Each tank also has (2) drain lines with (1) flow sensor.  Incoming and outgoing flow rates have to be manually adjusted for the tidal effect.  
  * outgoing tide: incoming flow rate to be lower than outgoing flow rate.  
  * incoming tide: incoming flow rate to be greater than outgoing flow rate.  
  * Note: The tank will not be completely empty during low tide events to prevent the recirculating powerhead from running dry.  
* Each tank has (1) CO2 supply line with an airstone connected to (1) solenoid valve to lower pH in tanks.  
* Air compressor connected to a CO2 scrubber will bubble air into the sump to bring pH to ambient or near-ambient conditions in the holding reservoir.  
* Each tank has individual LED lighting.  
* Tanks controlled via Neptune Systems Apex Controllers.  Each Apex controls (4) tanks.  
  * Controllable parameters are pH, temperature, tidal effect, and lighting.  

<a name="Apex_Connection_Series"></a> **Apex Connection Series**

* Each EnergyBar connects to the Base Unit with an AquaBus cable via the AquaBus Ports for power.  (2) EB832 units connect to (1) Base Unit.  
* Each CO2 Solenoid valve connects to the EnergyBar via the DC24 Accessory Port on the side of the EB832.  (2) Solenoid valves connect in (1) EB832.  
* (1) PM1 connects to (1) EnergyBar with an AquaBus cable via the AquaBus Ports, and all PM1 modules connect in series with each other for power.    
* VDM connects to the last PM1 in series with an AquaBus cable via the AquaBus Ports for power.  
* Temperature probes connect to the PM1 Temp Port or the Base Unit Temp Port.  (1) Temperature probe in each PM1, and (1) Temperature probe in the Base Unit.  
* pH probes connect to the PM1 pH/ORP Port or the Base Unit pH/ORP Port.  Push the BNC female connector of the probe on to the male connector and turn 1/4 turn clockwise to lock the connector in place.  (1) pH probe in each PM1, and (1) pH probe in the Base Unit.  
* [Halo light](https://github.com/SilbigerLab/Mesocosm_User_Manual/tree/394a3f7d9fed8765e4152f9fdd11d00a2ea87a93/Manuals/HALO_Quick_Start_Guide.pdf) connects to the VDM or Base Unit via the V1/V2 or V3/V4 Port.  (2) Light connections in the VDM and (2) Light connections in the Base Unit.  
* (1) FMM connects to (1) EnergyBar (whichever EB832 is not powering the PM1 modules) with an AquaBus cable via the AquaBus Ports, and all FMM connect in series with each other for power.  
* (3) Flow sensors connect to each FMM via (3) of the numbered ports.
