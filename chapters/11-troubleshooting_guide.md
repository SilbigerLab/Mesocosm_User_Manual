# Troubleshooting Guide

* Breaker tripped in the field room (pump, UV filter, CO2 scrubber all off)
    1. Call PPM (ext. 2222) and let them know a breaker tripped at Citrus Hall in the room next to the Mechanics Room on the outside and South side of Citrus.
    1. When PPM arrives, let them know the breaker box is on the 3rd floor of Citrus in Room 3303 and the switch is for EDP C-4
    1. Check for other items plugged into EDP C-4 outlets and alert PPM of anything that shouldn't be plugged into those outlets (e.g. CSUN golf carts)
