<a name="Tripped_Breaker"></a> **Tripped Breaker**
* Breaker tripped in the field room (pump, UV filter, CO2 scrubber all off)
    1. Call PPM (ext. 2222) and let them know a breaker tripped at Citrus Hall in the room next to the Mechanics Room on the outside and South side of Citrus.
    1. When PPM arrives, let them know the breaker box is on the 3rd floor of Citrus in Room 3303 and the switch is for EDP C-4
    1. Check for other items plugged into EDP C-4 outlets and alert PPM of anything that shouldn't be plugged into those outlets (e.g. CSUN golf carts)
    
<a name="Flowmeter_Misreadings"></a> **Flowmeter Misreadings**
* Flowmeter on ApexFusion is reading 0 or some incorrect value
* Sometimes the flowmeters (FM) inline with water flow will either have a bubble or some debris affecting the spin of the turbine within the FM. 
    1. Make sure to check the flowmeter connections back at the FMM module for a connection issue.  Unplug and plug back in the cable for the FM in question.
    1. Try clearing bubbles. If gently tapping the FM doesn't resolve the issue, you may have to remove the FM to clear it out.
*Removing the FM for cleaning
    1. Unscrew the FM at both of its compression fittings until the fittings are loose on the tubing, then pull gently at the tubings to remove them from the FMM (if the compression fitting is all the way unscrewed, but the tube isn't coming out of the FMM, pull a little harder beacuse sometimes the tubing just gets stuck in the FM).
    1. Visually expect the inside of the FM, and if needed, use a small long object to probe and spin the internal turbine to dislodge any debris.
