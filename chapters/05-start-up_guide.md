<a name="Basic_Operation"></a> **Basic Operation**

1. Operating water level in the filtration sump should be 7" in the filter cell compartment.
2. Water from the tanks will feed down to the outside sump pump, then into to the filtration skid.  From there the water will be pumped through the UV sterilizer and chiller barrel, then back to the tanks.
3. There are two valves located along the chiller flow line  
   a. One controls the flow directly back to the tanks  
   b. The other valve is the bypass valve which diverts the flow back to the sump  This is used to regulate the line pressure going back to the container. The more closed, the higher the pressure in the line, and the more open, the lower the pressure. The chiller has a safety flow switch that requires a minimum flow rate for the chiller to operate, so the bypass valve can be used to regulate the chiller flow as well as the container flow.  
4. Before filling the tanks make sure the drain valve located under the tank is closed.
5. Fill each rack one at a time and make sure rack and filtration skid flows are balanced before moving on to the next rack.
6. Make sure the complete system reaches equilibrium in standard recirculation mode before setting up the tidal cycle.
