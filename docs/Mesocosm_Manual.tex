 \textbf{System Operational Parameters}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  This is a closed loop system where water from each individual tank
  will recirculate back to a main holding reservoir (sump).\\
\item
  Normal High Tide operating water level is approximately 12.5``H for a
  total water volume of 14.37 gal per tank (total of 287.4 gal to fill
  the available 20 tanks).\\
\item
  Normal Low Tide operating water level is approximately 4``H for a
  total water volume of 4.60 gal per tank (92.0 gal total for the
  20-tank-system).\\
\item
  Excess water drained to the sump at low tide is 9.77 gal per tank
  (195.4 gal total for the 20-tank-system).\\
\item
  Normal sump operating water level is 7" water in the filter cell
  compartment, which has an approximate volume of 82.32 gal. Sump
  freeboard volume (max before overflow) is 107.39 gal.\\
\item
  Secondary sump available volume is 250 gal. To operate from a High
  Tide water level to a Low Tide water level, excess water must be
  redirected to the secondary sump to accomodate the excess volume (see
  below).\\
\item
  Aquaria drain pipe is in line with a 30 gal sump pump, which will draw
  water from the aquaria drain line and pump water to the sump.\\
\item
  Sump is in line with a secondary holding tank for sump overflow at Low
  Tide.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    195.4 gal returning to sump in a Low Tide scenario will be split
    between the main and secondary sumps so that water level is the same
    in each.\\
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Total system water volume should not exceed 390 gal - ideal
  water volume for this scenario is 375 gal total throughout the system}
\item
  Flow rate for each tank can be maintained at \textasciitilde{}2-6 GPH
  (See \href{chapters/07-tidal_manipulation.md}{Tidal Manipulation} for
  specific flow rates).\\
\item
  Chiller is plumbed inline with the
  \href{https://github.com/SilbigerLab/Mesocosm_User_Manual/blob/master/Manuals/Filtration_Skid_Build_Package.pdf}{filtration
  skid}, which includes mechanical/biological filtration as well as UV
  sterilization (chemical filtration).\\
\item
  One main pump recirculates the water flow throughout the experimental
  tanks and the main holding reservoir.\\
\item
  Each tank has an immersion heater that allows tank temperatures to be
  set \textasciitilde{}15 degF (8.3 degC) above the main holding tank
  reservoir.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{Note: The tank needs to have low flow or be static in order
    to initially heat up to desired temperatures much higher than the
    sump. Once the temperature has been reached in the system, then flow
    can be set to the normal operating rate.}\\
  \end{itemize}
\item
  A small sumbersible powerhead in each tank provides water circulation
  throughout the tank.\\
\item
  Each tank has (2) water supply lines, each with (1) Neptune Systems
  flow sensor and (1) needle valve for manual flow rate control, and (1)
  gate solenoid valve in line with (1) supply line for programmable
  tidal effect. Each tank also has (2) drain lines with (1) flow sensor
  in line with (1) needle valve for outgoing flow rate control, and (1)
  `overflow' line for maintaining maximum tank volume. Incoming and
  outgoing flow rates have to be manually adjusted for tidal effect.\\
\item
  Flow metered water lines

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    N: Main supply
  \item
    S: Solenoid-controlled supply
  \item
    D: Drain\\
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Tidal effect

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    outgoing tide: incoming flow rate (N + S) is lower than outgoing
    flow rate (D).
  \item
    incoming tide: incoming flow rate (N + S) is greater than outgoing
    flow rate (D).
  \item
    Note: The tank will not be completely empty during low tide events
    to prevent the recirculating powerhead from running dry.\\
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Each tank has (1) CO2 supply line with an airstone connected to (1)
  Neptune Systems solenoid valve to control the lowering and maintenance
  of pH in tanks.\\
\item
  CO2 scrubber comprised of (1) or (2) air compressors connected to (1)
  or (2) Phosban Reactors will bubble out CO2 from the sump water to
  bring up pH to ambient or near-ambient conditions in the holding
  reservoir to supply to the tanks.\\
\item
  Each tank has individual LED lighting, which can be controlled for
  white or blue light for natural daily light cycles or some other
  program.\\
\item
  Certain tank conditions can be controlled via Neptune Systems Apex
  Controllers. Each Apex controls (4) tanks.\\
\item
  Controllable parameters are: pH, temperature, tidal effect (S flow
  into the tank), and lighting.\\
\item
  Certain tank conditions can be monitored via Neptune Systems Apex
  Controllers. Each Apex monitors and records data for (4) tanks.\\
\item
  Monitored parameters include: pH, temperature, salinity, flow rates,
  relative light intensity, and the status of any set program (whether a
  unit is On of Off at any given time based on the program set)
\end{itemize}

 \textbf{Apex Connection Series}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Each EnergyBar connects to the Base Unit with an AquaBus cable via the
  AquaBus Ports for power. (2) EB832 units connect to (1) Base Unit.\\
\item
  Each CO2 Solenoid valve connects to the EnergyBar via the DC24
  Accessory Port on the side of the EB832. (2) Solenoid valves connect
  in (1) EB832.\\
\item
  (1)PM1 connects to (1) EnergyBar with an AquaBus cable via the AquaBus
  Ports, and all PM1 modules connect in series with each other for
  power.\\
\item
  VDM connects to the last PM1 in series with an AquaBus cable via the
  AquaBus Ports for power.\\
\item
  Temperature probes connect to the PM1 Temp Port or the Base Unit Temp
  Port. (1) Temperature probe in each PM1, and (1) Temperature probe in
  the Base Unit.\\
\item
  pH probes connect to the PM1 pH/ORP Port or the Base Unit pH/ORP Port.
  Push the BNC female connector of the probe on to the male connector
  and turn 1/4 turn clockwise to lock the connector in place. (1) pH
  probe in each PM1, and (1) pH probe in the Base Unit.\\
\item
  \href{https://github.com/SilbigerLab/Mesocosm_User_Manual/tree/394a3f7d9fed8765e4152f9fdd11d00a2ea87a93/Manuals/HALO_Quick_Start_Guide.pdf}{Halo
  light} connects to the VDM or Base Unit via the V1/V2 or V3/V4 Port.
  (2) Light connections in the VDM and (2) Light connections in the Base
  Unit.\\
\item
  (1)FMM connects to (1) EnergyBar (whichever EB832 is not powering the
  PM1 modules) with an AquaBus cable via the AquaBus Ports, and all FMM
  connect in series with each other for power.\\
\item
  (3)Flow sensors connect to each FMM via (3) of the numbered ports.
\end{itemize}

 \textbf{EB832 Outlet Connections}

Note: Each horizontal row on an EB832 corresponds to one tank, yielding
4 outlets per aquarium. Current outlet order, left to right:

\item

\end{enumerate}

 \textbf{Water Flow Operation}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Flow from the filtration sump to the mesocosm tanks

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Water from the chiller can be directed either back into the sump or
    to the mesocosm tanks or both simultaniously.\\
  \item
    The bypass valve is used to regulate the line pressure going back to
    the mesocosm tanks. The more closed, the higher the pressure in the
    line, and the more open, the lower the pressure.\\
  \item
    It is recommeded you maintain partial flow to the sump to maintain
    circulation within the sump and to not overwhelm the tanks with more
    water pressure than they can handle, depending on your flow rates
    in.\\
  \item
    Multiple valaves in line can be used to regulate the flow through
    the filtration system, though the chiller has a safety flow switch
    that requires a minimum flow rate for the chiller to operate.\\
  \item
    Minimize flow through the filtration system if you want to increase
    residence time of water through the UV sterilizer.\\
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Flow from the mesocosm tanks to the filtration sump

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Water from the tanks drains to an outdoor underground 30 gal
    compartment, which will automatically pump water out when a certain
    water level is reached (about 15 gal). This water can be directed
    either back into the sump, or if you intend to drain water in the
    event of a water change or the end of an experiment, water can be
    directed to a drain port.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Overflow from sump to secondary containment

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    When mesocosm water level falls from a high tide to low tide
    sequence, more water will drain to the sump than what the main sump
    can individually hold. Excess water can be redirected from the sump
    (S1) to the secondary containment (S2) by opening the S2 inflow
    t-valve (allows simultaneous flow of filtered, chilled water to both
    S2 and the mesocosm tanks), and an exchange t-valve (allows for
    continuous flow between S1 and S2).

 \textbf{Basic Operation}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Operating water level in the filtration sump should be at least 7" in
  the filter cell compartment, about 2 inches above the three carbon
  filters.
\item
  Outflow water from the tanks feeds down to the outside underground
  sump pump, then into to the filtration system inside the Citrus Hall
  Field Room.
\item
  Water pumped into the Field Room flows through three 50um bag filters
  and eight matala mesh filters before overflowing into the main holding
  reservoir. Reservoir water is pumped through three carbon filters, a
  UV sterilizer, and chiller, then either back into the holding
  reservoir or to the tanks.
\item
  Water directed toward the tanks has two potential inflow ports (one
  constant flow and one controlled by a solenoid) and two potential
  outflow ports (one overflow port and one controlled by a manual
  open/close needle valve to adjust tank volume)
\end{enumerate}

 \textbf{Filtration}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Biological and Mechanical Filtration: Water from the Mesocosm tanks is
  pumped into the sump while passing through three 50um bag filters and
  eight matala mesh filters (high and low density) to pick up debris.
  These filters have an accumulated biofilm to biologically filter the
  water before entering the sump and returning to the tanks.
\item
  Chemical and Mechanical Filtration: Water in the sump is pulled
  through three carbon filters with mesh filter sleeves and pumped into
  a UV sterilizer before entering the sump and returning to the tanks.
\end{itemize}

 \textbf{Sump Flow}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Preparing flow in the sump

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Before turning on the pump, make sure the correct channels of flow
    are opened to direct the water where it needs to go.
  \item
    The Meso Return valve should be vertical in the ``closed'' position
    (perpendicular to the PVC), and the Sump Return valve should also be
    vertical in the ``open'' position (in line with the PVC). See Figure
    1 to identify valves.
  \item
    The Pump Return valve should be veritcal in the ``open'' position to
    allow flow from the sump through the pump to the UV filter and
    chiller compartments. See Figure 2.

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{\arabic{enumiii}.}
    \tightlist
    \item
      If you do not intend to utilize the Secondary Sump at this time,
      close the Sump Exchange valve (as shown in Figure 2)
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    The two UV Flow valves and the Chiller Bypass valve should all be
    vertical. This directs flow down through the UV light chamber before
    pushing through to the chiller compartment. See Figure 3.\\
    \includegraphics{images/Sump_Flow_Valves.png}\\
    \includegraphics{images/Pump_Valve.png}\\
    \includegraphics{images/UV_Valves.png}\\
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Turning on sump flow

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Once all the valves are properly opened/closed as described above,
    plug in the Cascade Pump and make sure water is running through the
    system properly without any leaks. There may be some initial
    sputtering while air is pumped out of the pipes, but that should
    stop within a couple minutes.
  \item
    Look at the pump and make sure you can see water being pushed
    through the clear junction.

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{\arabic{enumiii}.}
    \tightlist
    \item
      If it looks like water is not running through the pump,
      \textbf{unplug the pump immediately}. Running the pump dry can
      burn out the motor.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    If everything seems to be stable, plug in the UV light.
  \item
    To stabilize the pH in the system, fill the PhosBan Reactors with
    CO2 absorption media and plug in the air pumps as
    \protect\hyperlink{CO2_Scrubber}{detailed below}.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

 \textbf{Mesocosm Tank Flow}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Filling the mesocosm tanks

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Make sure the drain valve located under each tank is closed (turned
    clockwise all the way, finger-tight).
  \item
    Fill each rack one at a time (only open the N flow valves for one
    set of 4 tanks at a time) and make sure rack and filtration skid
    flows are balanced before moving on to the next rack.

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{\arabic{enumiii}.}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Open the N flow valve for each tank (and S flow valve if you plan
      to turn on the solenoid {[}SOL-TNK-\#{]} to help fill the tanks).
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    To open flow from the sump to the tanks, first make sure the
    circular flow within the sump itself is stable. Then slowly open the
    Meso Return valve (turn counterclockwise) until the t-valve is
    sitting about 45 degrees to the PVC pipe. This configuration splits
    flow to both the sump and the mesocosm. You can further adjust water
    pressure to the tanks by slightly closing the Sump Return valve to
    direct more flow to the meso, less flow to the sump, while always
    keeping the line to the sump partially open.
  \item
    Once all tanks are filled, make sure the whole system is stable in
    standard recirculation mode before setting up a tidal cycle, if
    desired.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Set flow in tanks

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Calculate your desired residence time. When full, each tank holds 55
    liters, so divide 55L by your desired residence time and use that
    estimated value as your flow rate. Example: for a RT of 4 hours:
    55L/4hr = 13.75 L/hr
  \item
    Use the Neptune Systems flow meters as a guide for setting the flow,
    but for the most accurate flow rates, use a graduated cylinder to
    estimate flow into each tank.

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{\arabic{enumiii}.}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Using the example above: 13.75 L/hr = 229.2 mL/min = 38.2 mL/10
      seconds to efficiently check each tank's flow using a graduated
      cylinder
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    While higher flow is more stable, lower flow may change slightly
    throughout the day, so it is recommended to check and set flow twice
    per day: once in the morning and once in the afternoon/evening.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

 \textbf{CO2 Scrubber to Elevate pH}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Filling/Replacing media in the Phosban Reactor

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Unplug the airpump connected to the Phosban Reactor and disconnect
    both sets of tubing going into/out of the Reactor to easily handle
    it.
  \item
    Unscrew the lid of the Reactor, take off the red cap and black mesh,
    and pour out the used up media (purple if freshly used, grayish
    white if used and stale) into a bag or some other containment. Used
    media can be deposited in a standard trash receptacle.
  \item
    Use tape or parafilm to cover the hole of the small tube inside the
    Reactor before pouring in the new media (stark white pellets). Fill
    to \textbf{an inch below} the top of the small tube, so no media
    falls into the tube. Remove the covering from the small tube and
    replace the black mesh and red cap, aligning the red cap so it
    encapsulates the top of the small tube.
  \item
    Screw the lid back on, finger tight, and replace the Reactor on the
    side of the sump. Reconnect the tubing from the airpump to the side
    of the Reactor and from the air splitter to the front of the
    Reactor. Submerge the airstones connected to the air splitter tubing
    in the holding reservoir of the sump.
  \item
    Once you're sure everything's securely placed, plug in the air pump.
  \item
    Listen and feel for any air leaks and adjust tubing as necessary.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

 \textbf{Draining the Mesocosm and Sump}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The first step before draining any water is to turn off the
  powerheads, heaters, and CO2 solenoids in all mesocosm tanks.
  \textbf{The powerheads and heaters cannot be ON when dry or they may
  be damaged}.
\item
  You must also place caps on each pH probe filled with either DI water
  for temporary storage or KCl storage solution for long-term storage.
  \textbf{The probe tips cannot dry out or they will be damaged}.
\item
  When draining the tanks, drain one rack of 4 tanks at a time, to not
  overflow the drainage system.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If you intend to only drain the mesocosm tanks, but not the sump,
    then first make sure the Sump Return valve of the filtration system
    is fully open (parallel to the PVC), then turn off the flow of both
    the N and S valves for each tank, turning the valves clockwise, and
    remove the outflow pipes as described below. If needed, divert
    excess water into the secondary sump following the
    \protect\hyperlink{Overflow_into_Secondary_Sump}{``Overflow'' steps
    below}, and disregard the rest of these draining instructions.
  \item
    If you intend to drain the sump as well to fully shut down or clean
    out the system, then maintain high flow through the N valve into all
    tanks. Continue following this set of instructions.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Divert flow from the mesocosm tanks to the drainage port

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    There is a drain in the Mechanical Room behind the Field Room with
    PVC pipe facing downward inside. This PVC is connected to our system
    and is the location for all system drainage.
  \item
    Refer to Figure 1. for the following t-valve identities.
  \item
    \textbf{First open the System Drain Valve} by turning the valve so
    it aligns parallel to the PVC. This opens flow to the drainage port
    in the back room. Always open an avenue of flow before closing an
    avenue of flow to avoid back pressure build up.
  \item
    Second, partially close the Meso To Sump valve by turning the valve
    so it sits diagonal to the PVC. This will reduce incoming water from
    the mesocosm from entering the sump and will divert some flow out of
    the system.

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{\arabic{enumiii}.}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Do not yet close the Meso To Sump valve completely until you can
      ensure there is no overflow at the drainage port in the Mechanical
      Room.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Open tank drains

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Under each tank is a needle valve controlling drain flow through the
    smaller outflow pipe in each tank. Fully open this valve for the
    rack of 4 tanks, turning the needle counterclockwise.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Removing the outflow pipes

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    In each of the four tanks, \textbf{unscrew} the larger outflow pipe
    until it is fully removed and water in the tank can drain out from
    the lowest point in the tank.
  \item
    The smaller outflow tube can simply be pulled out from its slot,
    sometimes needing to be twisted to be unwedged.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  The sump pump located in the ground between the Mesocosm container and
  the Field Room will funcition normally to push water from the tanks to
  the Field Room system, but as you drain large volumes of water,
  periodically check that the water is not overflowing out of this
  in-ground reservoir.
\item
  Also periodically check the drainage port to make sure the water
  pumped from the tanks is not overflowing onto the floor of the
  Mechanical Room.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If you notice water is overflowing, slightly open the Meso To Sump
    valve to divert some water back into the sump and reduce the water
    volume diverted to the drainage port.
  \item
    \textbf{Do not allow salt water to overflow the drainage port of the
    Mechanics room}
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Unplug the UV light and air pumps, but leave the water pump on for
  now.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Allow the sump to continue pumping water from the main reservoir
    into the tanks, where the water will continuously drain out of the
    system.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Once the water level in the sump is about an inch or two below the top
  of the carbon filters (the three white cylinders inside the sump),
  unplug the Pump. \textbf{The pump must be turned off before it runs
  dry, otherwise the pump will be damanged}

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    At this point there will still be some water left in the sump, which
    can either be siphoned out and dumped into the drainage port, or you
    can use a small aquarium pump to pull water out of the main
    reservoir and the mesh filtration reservoirs.
  \item
    \textbf{Be cautious to not let this pump run dry either, or it may
    be damaged}
  \item
    To access the bio-filtration reservoir, remove the black and blue
    matala mesh filters, and clean them by hosing them down with
    freshwater (available just outside the Field Room door).
  \item
    To access the 50-micron mesh reservoir, remove the PVC pipe located
    directly after the Meso To Sump valve (see Figure 1) by unscrewing
    the PVC at the junction. This PVC pipe with three outports can be
    temporarily removed, so the mesh can be taken out and also sprayed
    down to clean.
  \item
    Remove the three carbon filters from the main reservoir to hose them
    down to clean.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Post-drainage

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Once the system is fully drained of seawater, screw back on the PVC
    pipe with three outports at the junction by the Meso To Sump valve.
    Also re-place each mesocosm tank's outflow pipes (screw in the large
    pipes and wedge in the small pipes).
  \item
    Follow the instructions in the
    \href{chapters/06-water_collection.md}{Water Collection Guide for
    filling the sump} with fresh water (attach a hose to the water pipe
    next to the Field Room door and fill the sump from the hose) and the
    order of operations for turning flow back on through the sump and
    tanks.
  \item
    You will not have to plug in the UV light or air pumps since you are
    not maintaining any water chemistry, but rather just flushing the
    system.
  \item
    Let fresh water run through the system for one to two days before
    following these same steps for draining the freshwater.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Once the system has been flushed with fresh water and drained again,
  remove the water inflow tubes from each tank's N and S ports to be
  acid washed and rinsed in DI water before next use.
\end{enumerate}

 \textbf{Overflow into Secondary Sump}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  If you need to contain more water in the system than the tanks and
  main reservoir can hold at one time (ex. during a ``low tide event''
  when half of the tank water is drained into the sump), then you will
  need to incorporate flow to and from the secondary sump.
\item
  First unplug the sump's main water pump to make sure the pump will not
  run dry if the water level drops too low (see details below).
\item
  To direct some flow from the mesocosm system into the secondary sump,
  partially or fully open the Secondary Sump Return valve (Figure 1), so
  that the t-valve runs parallel with the PVC. Filtered sump water will
  then be simultaniously directed into the mesocosm and the secondary
  sump, via PVC tubing that diverts water into the top of the secondary
  reservoir.
\item
  To then open flow between both the main holding reservoir and the
  secondary sump, open the Sump Exchange valve (Figure 2), so the
  t-valve runs parallel with the PVC.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Because this flow-through connection will allow water to flow
    between both reservoirs to establish water level equilibrium, make
    sure the water level in the main reservoir is still about 2 inches
    above the carbon filters after this water exchange has occurred. If
    not, add more seawater to the system until the carbon filters are
    once again submerged \textbf{to avoid the pump running dry}.
  \item
    Once the carbon filters are appropriately submerged (seawater just
    two inches above the filters, not much more), turn the main pump
    back on.
  \item
    The full system requires \textasciitilde{} 400 gallons of sea water
    to maintain tank volume and submersion of carbon filters while
    including use of the secondary sump.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

for details. 1. At least 24 hours before collecting water, email Mark
Loos
(\href{mailto:mark.loos@csulb.edu}{\nolinkurl{mark.loos@csulb.edu}}) of
your intent to get water, and give him an estimated time of arrival.
Check in with him or his appointed staff member upon arrival. 1. Check
that all three o-rings of the triple filter are in place and that the
filters are placed in order (left to right following direction of flow:
20um, 5um, 1um) before twisting the filters onto the base rack. Use the
locking ring to ensure a tight seal of the filter compartments onto the
rack. 1. Ensure that all components of the sump are prepared for water:
1. Three bag filters are in place 1. Eight matala filters are in place
1. Three carbon filters are in place, the open PVC end wedged into the
holes of the PVC located in the back of the holding tank 1. If you do
not intend to use the secondary sump, close the Sump Exchange valve (see
image below) \includegraphics{images/Pump_Valve.png} 1. Check that all
power cords are away from areas with possible water exposure 1. Once you
pick up the truck from behind Chaparral Hall, back it up to the large
stacked square bins in the same parking lot, near the side of the
building on the grass. 1. With the help of at least one other person,
lift and slide the top bin into the bed of the truck. Take off the lid
of the second bin and lift the second bin onto the bed of the truck.
Once in place, put the lid back on (lids weight an additional 15-20lbs).
1. Make sure you have all the items listed above laoded in the truck to
bring to SCMI. 1. Plan to leave CSUN for SCMI after 9am to avoid major
traffic, and wear or bring closed toed shoes to wear once you arrive. 1.
When you arrive at SCMI, back into the employee lot (the parking lot to
the left of the building when looking on from the street), back through
the lot and behind the building parallel to the wire fence. 1. Move the
cone before backing into the lot behind the building and replace the
cone when you leave.

 \textbf{Water Flow Procedure}\\
1. Near the wire fence, there is a large pool hose with a pvc loop
attachment. Remove the banjo attachemnt comprising of the PVC ``U'' on
the pool hose and attach the banjo adapter that connects to the triple
filter. Before connecting it to the filter, move this end of the hose to
the drain port (hole in the concrete flowing under the walkway). 1.
Unwind the SCMI garden hose enough to also place the outflow end at the
drain port. 1. Open the t-valve at the base of the pool hose
\textbf{half-way (at a 45 degree angle)} and fully open adjacent garden
hose (t-valve parallel to the PVC). 1. Refernce image for t-valve
alignment: \includegraphics{images/SCMI_hose_valves.png}\\
1. Walk over to the filtration area in the corner of the back lot (near
the fish pens) and locate the filter chamber (tall teal cylinder with
rounded top). Open the t-valve for the PVC pipe running from the base of
the filter chamber toward the wire fence (see image below). 1. There is
a power switch on the fence in line with the filter's PVC. Turning this
switch ON will initiate flow from the marina, through the filter, and
out the end of the pool hose. 1. \textbf{Do not turn on the power supply
until you have opened the other t-valves.} Doing so could cause pressure
buildup in the piping and damage the system. 1. Flip the switch ON and
leave the water running for 30 seconds to 1 minute to flush out any
standing water in the system.
\includegraphics{images/SCMI_filter_pvc.png}

 \textbf{Water Collection}\\
1. Connect the male end of the garden hose to the outflow end of the
triple filter, and place the female end inside one of the bins (you will
need to remove or offset the bin lids). 1. When you have finished
flushing out the system and are ready to fill the bins, turn off the
power supply without closing off any of the t-valves. 1. Attach the
banjo adapter to the triple filter, then turn on the power supply again.
This will initiate flow through the filters and into the bins. To avoid
pressure build-up in the system, allow the SCMI garden hose to
continuously pump water into the drain port. 1. Fillin the bins 1. If
you are filling up the entire mesocosm system, you will need to fill
both bins about 3/4 full twice to obtain 400 gallons, requiring two
trips to SCMI. 1. If you are only doing a partial water change or
refill, fill the bins with slightly more than you need in case any water
is lost en route to CSUN. 1. When you are finished filling,
\textbf{first turn off the power supply}, then close the t-valve on the
pipe between the power supply and the filter chamber, and finally close
the t-valves at the base of the hoses. 1. CLosing off any t-valves
before shutting off the power could cause a pressure build-up in the PVC
and may rupture the system. 1. Place the lids on the water containers
and use the ratchet straps or rope to secure the bin lids down (this
will help with water spillage on the drive back to CSUN). 1. Remove the
banjo adapter from the pool hose and the triple filter, and replace the
PVC ``U'' back on the pool hose. 1. Remove the garden hose from the
triple filter, then tilt the triple filter upside down to allow water
inside the filter chambers to flow out before loading it back in the
truck.

 \textbf{Filling the Sump}\\
1. Once back at CSUN, pull into the laoding bay between Citrus and
Eucalyptus, and back up to the Field Room, leaving just enough space to
open the door. 1. Unstrap and remove the lids. Place one end of the
large pool hose in one of the containers, and use a weight to keep it
from floating up. 1. Pull the free end of the hose to the sump, and
start a siphon. Gently wedge the end of the hose in between the
matalamesh filters in the sump for hands-free siphoning and to filter
the water as it goes into the system. 1. To start a gravity-fed siphon,
fill the hose with as much water as you can, displacing the air. Keep
one end of the hose weighed down in the seawater container and the other
end wedged in the sump. Starting near the sump end of the hose and
working toward the bin end, lift the hose section by section to redirect
the bulk of the water within toward the bin end until at least 1/3 of
the hose at the bin end is filled with water. Lower the hose section you
are holding to return flow back toward the sump end. 1. When water
volumne in the first bin is nearly at the top of the hose opening,
remove the weight while holding down the hose opening toward the bottom
of the bin. 1. Keep the opening at an angle to the bottom to allow for
continued suctioning of water without exposure to air. 1. When you are
ready to switch bins, preserve the siphon by cupping the palm of your
hand against the hose end, submerging the hose in the next bin, then
removing your hand. Place the weight again to avoid the hose floating to
the surface. 1. If you plan to collect water again that day, simply
replace the lids once you have finished siphoning, and drive back to
SCMI for another round. 1. Once you are finished filling the sump and
emptying the bins, attach the garden hose to the fresh water tap on the
outside of the Field Room, and turn on water by using the metal screw
key hanging on a pipe just inside the Field Room door to the left. 1.
Hose down the entire back, bed, and sides of the truck, everything that
may have been exposed to salt water. Also unscrew the filter chambers of
the triple filter and hose down the chambers, the rack, and the filters
sufficiently to clean off any debris or particulates. 1. Place the large
pool hose back in one of the bins, and once you turn off the hose water,
replace the key and store the garden hose back in the Field Room. 1.
Before parking the truck, back it up to the same location where you
picked up the bins, and drop/place the bins back on the grass. If there
is any water left in the bins, dump that out before leaving them
stacked.

\chapter{Tidal Manipulation}\label{tidal-manipulation}

Controling the tidal cycle of each experimental tank with the Apex. This
is achieved by manipulating the incoming and outgoing flow rates of each
individual tank with the needle valves described in the
\protect\hyperlink{system-details}{System Details}, and setting the
ON/OFF time cycle of the supply line with the solenoid. The basic
procedure is outlined below.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Set the flow rate of the supply line N{[}\#{]}FLW (without the
  solenoid), for example 10.5 Liters/Hr, by slowly turning the black
  knob counterclockwise to increase flow or clockwise to decrease flow.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    You can view rates on the Fusion dashboard.
  \item
    Note that the Apex controller has some lag time in registering the
    flow rate after the valve has been adjusted, and the delay can be up
    to 30 seconds or more, so make small adjustments and monitor the
    change on Fusion.
  \item
    Once the rate is set you should check periodically to make sure the
    rate has not changed both on Fusion and by using a graduated
    cylinder and a timer.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Adjust the outgoing flow rate of the drain line D{[}\#{]}FLW higher
  than the N{[}\#{]}FLW, for example 15 Liters/Hr.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    With the above condition, the outgoing flow rate is higher than the
    incoming, so this will create a low tide effect over a 5-5.25 hr
    period.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  To create a high tide effect, change the setting of SOL-TNK-\#
  (outlets 3 and 7 on each EB832) to ON on the Fusion dashboard, then
  manually turn on and adjust the flow rate of the supply line
  S{[}\#{]}FLW , for example 10 Liters/Hr.\\
\item
  Once the S{[}\#{]}FLW is set, change the setting of SOL-TNK-\# to AUTO
  on the Fusion dashboard.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    With the above condition, the total incoming flow rate (N+S) is
    higher thatn the outgoing (D), so this will create a high tide
    effect over a 5-5.25 hr period.
  \item
    For a constant ON/OFF cycle over a 12.5 hour period, the Advanced
    program should look like the program below:
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

Fallback ON\\
Osc 000:00/375:00/375:00 then ON

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  In the event the EnergyBar loses connection with the Apex Base,
  ``Fallback ON'' will keep the solenoid open, allowing water to
  continuously flow from S{[}\#{]}FLW.\\
\item
  The oscillate (Osc) command as written will open flow from
  S{[}\#{]}FLW for 6.25 hours, initiating the High Tide scenario, then
  close for 6.25 hours, initiating the Low Tide scenario. This will
  provide the effect of two high and two low tides of a semidiurnal
  tidal cycle over a 25 hour period.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Using the flow rates stated above, each tidal shift will last 5.25
    hours and maintain the tide height for 1 hour.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Controlling pH}\label{controlling-ph}

The pH is controlled with the addition of CO\textsubscript{2} gas to the
system. The gas is delivered to the tank by air stone and is controlled
through the Apex Controls with a solenoid valve connected to the EB832.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Once the CO\textsubscript{2} regulator is connected to a tank, open
  the main tank valve.
\item
  Use the pressure adjusting screw (larger knob in front with Tunze
  label) to adjust the pressure (in bar) on the pressure gauge. Turning
  \textbf{clockwise to open}, thus increasing pressure, while turning
  \textbf{counterclockwise to close}, thus reducing pressure.
\item
  The pressure should be set to 0.5 up to 1 bar on the gauge
  (\textasciitilde{}7.5psi) - ideally 0.6 bar.
\item
  Open the fine adjustment valve (smaller valve next to the tubing
  connecting the regulator to the tanks) to allow gas to the tank
  solenoid. If the pressure on the gauge is too high this may prevent
  the CO\textsubscript{2} solenoid from completely closing, which will
  inject excess CO\textsubscript{2} into the system.
\item
  Programming the solenoid for a consistent pH: pH-TNK-\#
\end{enumerate}

Control type: pH Control\\
Probe name: pH\\
Fallback: OFF\\
High Value: 8.2\\
Low Value: 7.9\\

\item
  Programming the solenoid for diel variance:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Using Advanced programming and Virtual outlets
  \item
    Create a unique virtual outlet for every time block which requires a
    different pH, and for every tank/probe which requires that pH
    treatment.
  \item
    Virtual Outlet Example (for the 6 hours between 6:31am and 12:30pm,
    the CO2 solenoid will dose CO2 into tank 1 while the probe reads
    8.10 or above):
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Fallback OFF\\
Set OFF\\
If Time 06:31 to 12:30 Then ON\\
If pH-1 \textless{} 8.10 Then OFF\\
* Advanced Program Example (Every 6 hours, the pH setpoint changes, and
each of the four time blocks has a unique virtual outlet name, as
presented below in the four programming lines. The CO2 solenoid will
dose the tank when the conditions of the virtual outlet program are
met):

Fallback OFF\\
Set OFF\\
If Output pH\_1\_630 = ON Then ON\\
If Output pH\_1\_1230 = ON Then ON\\
If Output pH\_1\_1830 = ON Then ON\\
If Output pH\_1\_0030 = ON Then ON

\chapter{Apex Programming Guide}\label{apex-programming-guide}

Recommendations for programming the Apex aquarium controllers designated
for the Silbiger Lab Mesocosm, located in the loading bay between Citrus
Hall and Eucalyptus Hall at California State University, Northridge.
These recommendations are for maintaining tanks at ambient conditions.
Changes should be made according to your study aims.

The following are using the numbered system of Apex1\_39106, controlling
tanks 1-4. All methods are transferrable across all 5 Apex controllers
to yield the same outcome in all 20 tanks, or change programs for varied

 \textbf{Downloading Data Logs}

When connected to the same network as the Apex units, you can download
data logs for the systems following the directions below.\\
\textbf{Note} To connect to the same network, you must plug your device
into one of the live ethernet cables in the Mesocosm.

Format for your internet browser URL:\\
\url{http://:/cgi-bin/outlog.xml?sdate=yymmddhhmm\&days=n}\\
\url{http://:/cgi-bin/datalog.xml?sdate=yymmddhhmm\&days=n}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Accessible logs:
\item
  Outlog -- every time the Apex changes the state of an outlet a record
  is written to this log. If no outlet ever changed state you would have
  zero records in this log. A new log is started daily at midnight. Log
  is named ``yymmdd.odat''.
\item
  Datalog -- records probe value snapshots (Temp, pH, ORP, etc.) based
  on the logging interval you define (default = 20 minutes). You can
  change the interval via the Display module under Data Log -- Log
  Interval. A new log is started daily at midnight. Log is named
  ``yymmdd.pdat''.
\end{itemize}

Examples of what to enter into your internet browser:\\
\url{http://172.24.113.25/cgi-bin/outlog.xml?sdate=191005}\\
\url{http://172.24.113.25/cgi-bin/outlog.xml?sdate=191005\&days=7}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The value after date= is the start date for when you want logged
  information, and days=n yields data n days after that start date.
\item

 \textbf{Loss of Power to the Sump/Tripped Breaker}\\
1. Breaker tripped in the field room (pump, UV filter, CO2 scrubber all
off) 1. If you just plugged in an item that correlated with the power
shutting off, unplug that item. It may have tripped the breaker. 1.
Check for other items plugged into EDP C-4 outlets that shouldn't be
plugged in or seem out of place. Alert PPM of anything that shouldn't be
plugged into those outlets (e.g.~CSUN golf carts). 1. Make sure it's a
tripped breaker and not the GFI outlet needing to be reset. 1. On the
West wall inside the Field Room, just to the right of the secondary
sump, there is a quadplex (4-plug outlet) that has a Reset button. Push
that button until you hear a click. If you hear the click but the power
is not restored, then follow the next steps. 1. This GFI outlet is also
connected to the quadplex down by the sump on the South wall, so all 8
outlets are controlled by the GFI and could initiate the need for a
Reset. 1. Call PPM (818-677- ext. 2222) and let them know a breaker
tripped at Citrus Hall in outside room 3114 - the room next to the
Mechanics Room on the outside and South side of Citrus Hall. 1. When PPM
arrives, let them know the breaker box is on the 3rd floor of Citrus in
Room 3303 and the switch is for EDP C-4

 \textbf{Sump Pump Malfunction and Turning off flow to the Mesocosm
Tanks}\\
1. If the sump pump (the outside underground pump between the Mesocosm
container and the Field Room) stops pumping water to the sump, it will
overflow out onto the concrete and into the loading bay driveway. 1. If
you notice the pump has malfunctioned, do the following: 1. Check if the
GFI outlet on the outside of the Mesocosm container needs to be reset.
On the 2-plut outlet, there is a Reset button. Push that button until
you hear a click. If you hear the click but the pump does not respond
(or you see the light at the bottom right corner of the outlet flash
red), then follow the next steps. 1. Turn off flow to the Mesocosm tanks
1. There is a \textbf{T-valve} located along PVC which goes from the
chiller to outside the Field Room. Turn this T-valve \textbf{clockwise}
so it sits perpendicular to the PVC, closing off flow from the sump to
the mesocosm, but retaining circulating flow within the sump. 1. The
T-valve is in line with a PVC pipe running parallel to the sump,
slightly above and to the side of the blue and black biofilter mesh.

 \textbf{Turning off Sump Flow}\\
1. If a situation arises where you need to shut off the recirculating
flow of the entire system, unplug the UV light from the South wall
quadplex, then unplug the pump from the same quadplex. 1. If you would
like to also turn off the CO2 scrubber, unplug both air pump plugs from
the same South wall quadplex.

 \textbf{Flowmeter Misreadings}\\
1. Flowmeter on ApexFusion is reading 0 or some incorrect value 1.
Sometimes the flowmeters (FM) inline with water flow will either have a
bubble or some debris affecting the spin of the turbine within the FM.
1. Make sure to check the flowmeter connections back at the FMM module
for a connection issue. Unplug and plug back in the cable for the FM in
question. 1. Try clearing bubbles. If gently tapping the FM doesn't
resolve the issue, you may have to remove the FM to clear it out. 1.
Removing the FM for cleaning 1. Turn off flow to the Mesocosm Tanks and
wait 15-20 minutes to ensure there is no flow to the tanks. 1. Unscrew
the FM at both of its compression fittings until the fittings are loose
on the tubing, then pull gently at the tubings to remove them from the
FMM (if the compression fitting is all the way unscrewed, but the tube
isn't coming out of the FMM, pull a little harder beacuse sometimes the
tubing just gets stuck in the FM). 1. Visually expect the inside of the
FM, and if needed, use a small long object to probe and spin the
internal turbine to dislodge any debris.

 \textbf{Rebooting the Apex}\\
1. If the Apex needs to be restarted for any reason, there are multiple
ways to reboot the system. 1. Apex Fusion 1. Click the Expand Settings
gears icon and go to the Misc page (wrench icon). 1. Under Power, check
the box for Reboot: Restart Apex, then click the orange cloud in the
upper right corner to send this command to Apex. Wait a few minutes for
the devices to come back online. 1. Restart Button 1. Under the Apex
Base Unit, above the pH port, there is a small hole encasing the Restart
button. 1. Insert a push pin or small object until you feel the button
press down and hold about 10 seconds. 1. If you require a full system
reboot back to factory settings, hold this button for 1 minute. This
will erase all modules, programming, log data, and probe calibrations,
so be very sure.

 \textbf{Light not responding to program}\\
1. Sometimes manually turning the light OFF on Apex, then back ON again,
the light will function properly. 1. If a light doesn't turn on when the
program indicates it should be ON, go into Programming settings for
Light-TNK-\#, adjust the advanced program slightly (e.g.~change an
``ON'' to an ``OFF'') and click the orange cloud to send to the Apex.
Then change the program back to what it was before you made a change,
then see if the light resumes its proper program. 1. If the light still
doesn't turn on, try \protect\hyperlink{Reboot_Apex}{rebooting the
apex}.

 \textbf{pH Probe Malfunction}\\
1. If a pH probe is giving an `off' reading, first calibrate the probe.
1. On your Fusion dashboard, click the gear symbol to the right of the
pH reading to go to its settings. 1. Select Automatic Calibration, and
follow the instructions, using new packets of 7 and 10 calibration
solution. 1. When placing the probe into the calibration solution, swirl
the probe in the solution a little before starting the reading. 1. If
the reading is still off, go back into the pH probe's settings on Fusion
and select Advanced to do a Manual Calibration. 1. Make sure Temp
Compensate is Disabled then select Manual Calibration, and follow the
instructions. 1. When placing the probe into the calibration solution,
swirl the probe in the solution a little before starting the reading.
Let the probe sit in the calibration solutions for about 5 minutes (or
longer as necessary) to ensure a stable reading. 1. If the reading is
still off after both the Automatic and Manual Calibrations, try a
Factory Reset. 1. Go back into the pH probe's settings on Fusion and
select and select Advanced. 1. Select Manual Calibration again, but this
time just click ``Next'' through the steps quickly. Don't let the
numbers settle. Then click ``Finish''. If the numbers for the 7 and 10
calibrations are the same, the probe calibration will be wiped and
reset, ready for a new calibration. 1. From the Apex's ``Misc''
settings, check the box for Reboot: Restart, and click the orange cloud
to send this command to the Apex. Wait for the Apex to fully reboot. 1.
Run through the Manual Calibration steps again. 1. If after following
the above steps, the pH probe is still malfunctioning, call Neptune
Systems for support.

 \textbf{pH Spikes}\\
1. If you noticed the pH in your take plummetting down when the CO2
solenoid is actively dosing. 1. It is likely that the fine tuning needle
valve on the tank's CO2 solenoid needs to be closed a little more
(turned slightly clockwise) to bring the flow of CO2 out of the air
stone bubbler down. 1. If the flow is too high, this could cause rapid
changes in pH in your tank before the probe can even detect the change.
1. By the time the probe detects the change and turns off the bubbler,
plus with a slight residual time between the solenoid closing and the
remaining CO2 gas being emitted from the bubbler, the pH may have
dropped lower than desired. 1. Turn the CO2 flow down using the large
nob on the solenoid's needle valve so that you see a gentle stream of
bubbles slowly coming from the bubbler. 1. The CO2 solenoid is connected
to the tank's bubbler tubing. It is a white box with the Neptune Systems
logo and an arrow indicating flow direction. Connecting the tubing and
the white box is a metal needle valve. The end knob of that needle valve
can be turned slightly for fine tuning gas flow.
