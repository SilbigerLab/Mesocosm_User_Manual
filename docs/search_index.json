Normal High Tide operating water level is approximately 12.5“H for a total water volume of 14.37 gal per tank (287.4 gal total for the 20-tank-system). Normal Low Tide operating water level is approximately 4“H for a total water volume of 4.60 gal per tank (92.0 gal total for the 20-tank-system). Excess water volume to sump at low tide is 9.77 gal per tank (195.4 gal total for the 20-tank-system). Normal sump operating water level is 7&quot; water in the filter cell compartment, which has an approximate volume of 82.32 gal. Sump freeboard volume is 107.39 gal. Aquaria drain line is in line with a 30 gal sump pump, which will draw water from the aquaria drain line and pump water to the sump. Sump is in line with a secondary holding tank for sump overflow at Low Tide. 195.4 gal returning to sump 30 gal in sump pump 107.39 gal in sump (freeboard volume) 58.01 gal necessarily pumped to secondary holding tank Flow rate for each tank is 2-6 GPH. Chiller is plumbed inline with the filtration skid which includes mechanical/biological filtration as well as UV sterilization (chemical filtration). One main pump will be used to recirculate the water flow throughout the experimental tanks and the main holding reservoir. Each tank will have an immersion heater that will allow tank temperatures to be set 15 degF (8.3 degC) above the main holding tank reservoir. Note: The tank needs to be static in order to heat up to a desired temp. Once the temperature has been reached then it can be set to flow through mode. Small sumbersible powerhead in each tank will provide water circulation throughout the tank. Each tank will have (1) supply line with (2) flow sensors, (1) solenoid valve for CO2 input, and (1) gate valve for tidal effect, and (2) drain lines with (1) flow sensor. Incoming and outgoing flow rates will have to be manually adjusted for the tidal effect. outgoing tide: incoming flow rate to be lower than outgoing flow rate. incoming tide: incoming flow rate to be greater than outgoing flow rate. Note: The tank will not be completely empty during low tide events to prevent the recirculating powerhead from running dry. Each tank will have individual LED lighting. Tanks controlled via Neptune Systems Apex Controller. Each Apex will control (4) tanks. Controllable parameters are pH, temperature, tidal effect, and lighting. Air compressor connected to a CO2 scrubber will bubble air into the holding to bring pH to ambient or near-ambient conditions in the holding reservoir.

["start-up-guide.html", "5 Start-up Guide", " 5 Start-up Guide Operating level in the filtration sump should be about 1“‐2” above the filter cells. Water from the container will gravity feed back to the filtration skid, and from there it is pumped through the UV sterilizer and chiller barrel and back to the container. There are two valves located after the chiller One controls the flow directly back to the container The other valve is the bypass valve which diverts the flow back to the filtration sump. This is used to regulate the line pressure going back to the container. The more closed the higher the pressure in the line, the more open the lower the pressure. The chiller has a safety flow switch that requires a minimum flow rate for the chiller to operate, so the bypass valve is used in this case to regulate the chiller flow as well as the container flow. Before filling the tanks make sure the drain valve located under the tank is closed. Fill each rack one at a time and make sure rack and filtration skid flows are balanced before moving on to the next rack. Make sure the complete system reaches equilibrium in standard recirculation mode before setting up the tidal cycle. "],
["tidal-manipulation.html", "6 Tidal Manipulation", " 6 Tidal Manipulation Controling the tidal cycle of each experimental tank with the Apex. This is achieved by manipulating the incoming and outgoing flow rates of each individual tank with the needles described in the System Details, and setting the ON/OFF time cycle of the supply line with the solenoid. The basic procedure is outlined below. Set the flow rate of the supply line without using the solenoid (moving forward we will refer to this valve as N[#]FLW as named in the APEX Fusion dashboard), for example 4 GPH. Note that the Apex controller has some lag time in registering the flow rate after the valve has been adjusted, the delay can be up to 30 seconds or more. Once the rate is set you should not have to adjust it again. Adjust the outgoing flow rate of the drain line D[#]FLW higher than the N[#]FLW, for example 6 GPH. With the above condition, the outgoing flow rate is higher than the incoming, so this will create the low tide effect. To set the high tide effect, manually turn the supply line S[#]FLW with solenoid ON, and adjust the flow rate, for example 4 GPH. Once the S[#]FLW is set, change setting to AUTO on the Fusion page. For a constant ON/OFF time within a 24 hour period the Advanced program should look something like the program below, note that time features in the Apex programming is based on 24 hour clock. Fallback OFF Set OFF If time 8:00 to 14:00 then ON If time 20:00 to 2:00 then ON For a more advance programming feature, start on Page 64 of the Comprehensive Manual for Seasonal Features and specifically Moon cycles. This should allow for a more realistic cycle. In summary in a tidal cycle event the flow rates for the drain line and both supply lines are constant, and the tide effect is controlled via the solenoid increasing or decreasing the flow rate into the individual tanks.

["controlling-ph.html", "7 Controlling pH", " 7 Controlling pH The pH is controlled with the addition of CO2 gas to the system. The gas is delivered to the tank by air stone and is controlled through the Apex Controls with a solenoid valve connected to the EB832. Once the CO2 regulator is connected to a tank, open the main tank valve. Use the pressure adjusting screw to adjust the pressure (in bar) on the pressure gauge. Turning clockwise will open thus increasing pressure, while turning counterclockwise will close thus reducing pressure. The pressure should be set to 0.5 up to 1 bar on the gauge (~7.5psi) Open the fine adjustment valve to allow gas to the tank solenoid. If the pressure on the gauge is too high this may prevent the CO2 solenoid from completely closing, which will inject excess CO2 into the system. Programming the solenoid The solenoid granting passage of CO2(g) to the tank is plugged into outlet 3 (or 7) on each EB832. Outlet name: SOL-TNK-# Fallback OFF Set OFF If pH &gt; 8.2 Then ON Refer to Comprehensive Manual for set point programming. "],
